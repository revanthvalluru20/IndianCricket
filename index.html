        <!-- BCCI Formation -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>BCCI: Journey & Growth</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)</strong> was founded in <strong>December 1928</strong> at the Roshanara Club in Delhi. It replaced the British-controlled Calcutta Cricket Club as the central governing body for cricket in India. BCCI became a member of the Imperial Cricket Conference (now ICC) in 1929, giving India official international representation in world cricket. 
        </p><br>

        <p>
            After <strong>India’s independence in 1947</strong>, the BCCI took charge of developing cricket across the country. India played its first Test under BCCI’s recognition in <strong>1948 against Australia at Brisbane</strong>. Over the next decades, BCCI organized domestic tournaments like the <strong>Ranji Trophy</strong>, <strong>Duleep Trophy</strong>, and <strong>Irani Cup</strong>, which became the backbone of Indian cricket.
        </p><br>

        <p>
            The turning point came with India’s <strong>1983 World Cup victory</strong> under Kapil Dev, which boosted cricket’s popularity nationwide. The rise of television broadcasting in the 1990s, combined with the arrival of stars like Sachin Tendulkar, helped BCCI secure major sponsorship and media deals.
        </p><br>

        <p>
            The biggest revolution was the launch of the <strong>Indian Premier League (IPL)</strong> in 2008, a global cricket league combining entertainment, business, and talent. The IPL turned into one of the world’s richest sporting leagues, creating enormous revenue through <strong>broadcasting rights, sponsorships, ticket sales, and merchandising</strong>.
        </p><br>

        <p>
            Today, BCCI is valued at over <strong>₹20,000 crore (approx. $2.5 billion)</strong> and reported record revenues of <strong>₹9,741 crore in 2023–24</strong>. It is the <strong>wealthiest cricket board in the world</strong> and a major decision-maker in the <strong>International Cricket Council (ICC)</strong>. BCCI also invests in stadium upgrades, training academies, and grassroots cricket, ensuring the sport’s growth at every level.

        <p>
            From a modest body with no funds in 1928, the BCCI has grown into the <strong>financial and administrative powerhouse of world cricket</strong>. Its journey reflects not just the rise of Indian cricket, but also the transformation of cricket into a global sport led by India.
